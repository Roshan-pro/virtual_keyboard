ðŸš€ Virtual Hand Gesture Keyboard Using Computer Vision ðŸ¤–

Check out this innovative project that combines OpenCV and MediaPipe to create a virtual keyboard controlled by hand gestures! âœ‹ðŸ’»

Key Highlights:
Gesture-Based Typing: The system uses hand landmarks to detect finger positions and translate them into keystrokes, allowing users to type by simply pointing at virtual keys.
Real-Time Interaction: The virtual keyboard is displayed on the screen, and typing is done by moving your fingers near the keysâ€”great for creating a touchless typing experience.
Tech Stack:
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision and frame capture.
MediaPipe: For detecting hand landmarks and tracking finger positions.
Pynput: To simulate keyboard input based on the detected gestures.
This project is a great example of how computer vision can transform everyday tasks, offering both accessibility and convenience. It's especially useful for users who need a touch-free input method!

Feel free to explore the code and modify it for your own applications. Happy coding! ðŸ’¡
